# Openshift PS Repo

This repository is aimed at collecting all relevant links and information for IL PS knowledge sharing.   

## Repo Contents Structure

This section explains the desired directory structure and repo tree that should be implemented.  Note that if the relevant directory or file does not exist yet, then please create based on the following tree outline:

```
openshift\workshops
openshift\usecases
openshift\featureReference
openshift\tools
```

## How to add items

The following is the procedure on how to add items to the repo.  This is based on git practicies in order to colloborate correctly on documents etc

```
1. Create a branch of the repo
2. Make the changes/additions that you want
3. Commit the changes to your fork
4. Enter a Pull request
```

To follow best practicies, I believe that we can maintain the approach where no one merges there own pull request.  Therefore, once you have put in a pull request you can contact another team member to review and perform the merge.

Once the update is merged, i recommend either deleting the branch or making sure to update the branch from the master before making additional changes/additions that you would like to merge.
