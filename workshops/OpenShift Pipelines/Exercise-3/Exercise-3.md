# Exercise 3

Welcome to Exercise 3 in our workshop. In this part we will talk about Infrastructure As Code and how can we utilizes it within a pipeline.  
Once we understand all the concepts (and play with them a little bit) we will build a Lister and a Web hook to monitor for changes in our GIT server and deploy an new changes that may be (after commit)

## IAC

BY Definition :
"Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through   machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as  bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system (GIT). It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches."  

### We can't talk about IAC without DevOps

## DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.  DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology. 

### IAC and DevOps Relationship

IaC can be a key attribute of enabling best practices in DevOps â€“ Developers become more involved in defining configuration and **Ops teams get involved earlier in the development process**.

Automation in general aims to take the confusion and error-prone aspect of manual processes and make it more efficient, and productive  

While building an Application we are getting:

  - Automation
  - flexibility 
  - less downtime
  - overall cost effective
  - reduce the complexity
  - collaboration
