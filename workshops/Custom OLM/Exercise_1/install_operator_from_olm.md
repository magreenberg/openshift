# Installing Operator from OLM

In order to understand how OLM works we first needs to be a client of OLM.
for this exercise we will login to our running cluster and install an Operator 
from our prebuild custom OLM.

## GUI View

On the OpenShift Console , login as Cluster Admin and Go to :
**Operators** --> **OperatorHUB**
